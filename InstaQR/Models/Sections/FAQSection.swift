        answer: """
        While your phone is locked, firmly long-press on the screen. This will reveal your share \
        action (QR Barcode). If the other person has an iPhone, all he/she has to do is lanuch the \
        camera app and point it at the barcode. The camera automatically detects the QR code and \
        activates the share action.

    FAQ(question: "Why is my wallpaper low resolution on lockscreen?",
        answer: """
        During the wallpaper setup, iOS preprocesses the live photos which causes a distortion \
        compared to the orginal. Unfortunantly, this is managed by the phone's operating system, \
        which means we currently can not provide a fix for it.
